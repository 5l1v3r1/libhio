\section{Introduction}

libhio is a library that provides a general API for performing
file-based IO to a hierarchal data store with one or more levels. The
library currently supports writing to either a parallel file system
(PFS), a burst buffer (BB), or a combination of a BB with a PFS.

This document describes the design philosophy of libhio. A high-level
description of the design of libhio is provided in \ref{sec:design}
and milestones are specified in \ref{sec:milestones}.
