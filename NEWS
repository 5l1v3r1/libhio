HIO NEWS
========

Last updated 2015-12-17

Release hio.1.2.0.0:

Switched from XML to JSON format for the manifest file.  This means that hio
datasets created with previous releases cannot be read with this version. We
don't expect to be this casual about incompatible changes in the future, but
since at the moment, hio is only being used for development and testing
activities an exception seems reasonable.

Minor bug fixes, diagnostic, testing and build improvements.
