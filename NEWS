HIO NEWS
========

Last updated 2016-02-24


Release hio.1.2.0.3:

Minor documentation and test fixes and enhancements.


Release hio.1.2.0.2:

Updated statistics reported when HIO_print_statistics is set to report the
overall (dataset open -> close) read/write speed and instantaneous
read/write speed. The speed is now only reported by the first rank in the
context. Removed error messages when 0-byte dataset manifests are
encountered. Fixed bugs when using datawarp including deleting the wrong
dataset ID after staging a new dataset ID. Added new variables to expose the
RAID level and filesystem type backing a dataset. New manifests are now
written ending in a newline instead of a NULL character. This does not
break backwards compatibility with 1.2.x.x releases.  Added staging test
run20.  Added Trinity step-by-step build and run procedure to README.  
Minor build and test improvements.


Release hio.1.2.0.1:

Test scripts enhanced with new, larger size options y and z. Multi-test
script run_combo added.  Added -m <msub_args> option. Also, additional
minor build and testcase fixes.


Release hio.1.2.0.0:

Switched from XML to JSON format for the manifest file.  This means that hio
datasets created with previous releases cannot be read with this version. We
don't expect to be this casual about incompatible changes in the future, but
since at the moment, hio is only being used for development and testing
activities an exception seems reasonable.

Minor bug fixes, diagnostic, testing and build improvements.
