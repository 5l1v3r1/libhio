HIO NEWS
========

Last updated 2016-03-25

release hio.1.3.0.0-rc1:

Updated external interface to allow for configuration of datasets before
open. Two existing functions have been modified and two new functions have
been added. The new functions are hio_dataset_alloc and hio_dataset_free
which take the same arguments as the old hio_dataset_open and
hio_dataset_close respectively. hio_dataset_open and hio_dataset_close now
only take a hio_dataset_t handle. After a dataset has been allocated using
hio_dataset_alloc it can be configured using hio_config_set_value. A new
function hio_object_get_name() has been added to get the name associated
with a context, dataset, or element handle.  The example in the API document
has not yet been updated.  See tests/test01.c for a working example of the
modified API.  Numerous minor documentation and test fixes and enhancements.

Release hio.1.2.0.3:

Minor documentation and test fixes and enhancements.


Release hio.1.2.0.2:

Updated statistics reported when HIO_print_statistics is set to report the
overall (dataset open -> close) read/write speed and instantaneous
read/write speed. The speed is now only reported by the first rank in the
context. Removed error messages when 0-byte dataset manifests are
encountered. Fixed bugs when using datawarp including deleting the wrong
dataset ID after staging a new dataset ID. Added new variables to expose the
RAID level and filesystem type backing a dataset. New manifests are now
written ending in a newline instead of a NULL character. This does not
break backwards compatibility with 1.2.x.x releases.  Added staging test
run20.  Added Trinity step-by-step build and run procedure to README.  
Minor build and test improvements.


Release hio.1.2.0.1:

Test scripts enhanced with new, larger size options y and z. Multi-test
script run_combo added.  Added -m <msub_args> option. Also, additional
minor build and testcase fixes.


Release hio.1.2.0.0:

Switched from XML to JSON format for the manifest file.  This means that hio
datasets created with previous releases cannot be read with this version. We
don't expect to be this casual about incompatible changes in the future, but
since at the moment, hio is only being used for development and testing
activities an exception seems reasonable.

Minor bug fixes, diagnostic, testing and build improvements.
