cantest README
==============

Last updated 2017-02-15


Description
-----------

cantest.py is a program which tests the effects of cancelling various 
Moab/DataWarp sub-jobs at various points in the execution of the overall job.

cantest is designed to use the existing hio tests (i.e., run02, run03, etc.)
to submit DataWarp test jobs.  It has some dependencies on the content of
job startup messages and result checking messages in those tests.

Current Status
--------------

cantest is currently fully functional, but only has a limited number of
test cases defined.  These tests are sufficient to find multiple problems.
As those problems are corrected, we will add additional test cases.

cantest is able to run multiple tests in parallel. That, of course,
complicates problem diagnosis. Currently, all but a single test case
is commented out.  This makes cantest easier to run and understand its
messages and results.  Ultimately, all tests should be uncommented, run
in parallel and additionally, repetitive running with randomization of 
sequence and parameters should be added. 


Cantest Operation
-----------------

Cantest will:

 1) Start a status thread which periodically:
    a) Monitors job status by issuing mdiag -j
    b) The status of every job ID in the tjob dict is extracted from the XML
       returned by mdiag and placed in the gstat dict.
    c) Checks for the existence of cantest.quit file and sets the quit flag
 
 2) Start a number of threads, each of which:
    a) Launches an hio/DataWarp test case which submits a job
    b) Adds the job's job IDs to the tjob array
    c) Periodically checks job status in gstat until a target status is reached
    d) Issues an mjobctl -c command for one of the sub-jobs
    e) Waits until all subjobs are complete or the quit flag is set
    f) Checks the results of the job
	
 The 4 sub-jobs that comprise a DataWarp job are referred to as a "job group".  	
 The status of the job group is described by 4 letters, one for each of the  	
 stage-in, tracking, compute and stage-out sub-jobs.  Each letter is the 	
 first  letter of the QueueStatus returned by mdiag (active, eligible, blocked).
	
 Job groups are designated by the job ID of the compute job.  This is used as	
 key for the tjob and gstat dictionaries and is displayed as "{jobid}" at the
 start of messages whenever possible.
	
 Locking - since dictionary updates are atomic, locking is only needed to	
 prevent the addition or deletion of dictionary entries while the dictionary
 is being iterated by another thread.  This is achieved by a global lock that
 is held by addjob() when adding entries to tjob and gstat and by bldstat()
 when iterating over those dictionaries.


Usage
-----

Steps to use cantest:

1) Build and install the HIO library on a system with DataWarp and Moab.

2) cd to libhio-x.y.x/test

3) Edit the main() procedure at the bottom of cantest.py to include
   the desired testcases with appropriate parameters.

4) Invoke via:

     python cantest.py 2>&1 | tee cantest.out

5) cantest will submit one or more jobs and remain active monitoring the
   state of those jobs, issuing a cancel command when the target state is
   reached. It will then wait for completion of the job and check the job's
   output file for the expected result.

6) Often (at the moment anyway) one or more of the jobs being run will 
   not complete, so cantest will appear to hang.  After waiting long enough
   and looking at the output from showq, you will conclude that no further
   progress will occur.  At this point, you should tell cantest to quit 
   by creating a file in the current directory.  From a different window,
   in the same working directory, issue:

     touch cantest.quit

7) cantest will stop waiting for job completion and will check the results
   of any jobs that were active.

8) Check for test case results by searching the cantest's output for the
   string "cantest result" via a command like:

     grep -i "Cantest result" cantest.out

the output is repeated with commentary.  Only a single test case is run.
